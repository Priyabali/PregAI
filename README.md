#PregAI – Predictive System for Pregnancy Risk & Fetal Brain Health Detection
This project uses Machine Learning models to predict pregnancy complications based on clinical data.

#Description
- Linear Regression for basic risk prediction
- Deep Neural Network (DNN) for accurate classification (High Risk / Low Risk)
